# Pico y Placa Predictor

A command-line application that predicts whether a vehicle can be on the road based on Quito-Ecuador's "Pico y Placa" restrictions.

## About

This project implements a predictor for Quito's vehicle circulation restrictions. The system determines if a vehicle with a specific license plate number can circulate on a given date and time, following the official "Pico y Placa" regulations.

## Problem Statement

The "Pico y Placa" is a traffic regulation in Quito that restricts vehicle circulation based on the last digit of the license plate number, the day of the week, and specific time windows during the day.

The application will:
- Accept a license plate number (e.g., PBX-1234)
- Accept a date and time
- Return whether the vehicle can be on the road or not
